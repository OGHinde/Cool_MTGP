This repository provides libraries and code to use the model proposed in the original paper, as well as replicate most of the results.

The repository is still very much a work in progress.

The datasets in /datasets/real/ were downloaded from http://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets-mtr.html

WHAT WORKS:
For now, please check out the CoolMTGP_basic_demo and CoolMTGP_variance_demo notebooks, which showcase the model's basic functionalities.

TO DO:
  - The /lib/ folder needs to be cleaned and organised.
  - The full pipeline for the real dataset experiments needs to be upladed (so far only the main script, run_experiments_real.py, is available).
  - The full pipeline for the synthetic experiments needs to be uploaded.
  - A user-friendly version for the PyTorch version of the model needs to be implemented.
